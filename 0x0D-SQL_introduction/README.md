The commands in SQL are called Queries and they are of two types:
• Data Definition Query: The statements which defines the
structure of a database, create tables, specify their keys,
indexes and so on
• Data manipulation queries: These are the queries which can
be edited.
E.g.: Select, update and insert operation
